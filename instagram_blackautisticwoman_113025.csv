1,"Happy Thanksgiving 🫶🏽

Feeling so blessed today and everyday, for the people I love, the quiet moments that ground me, the routines that comfort me, and the little pieces of life that add up to something beautiful. Grateful for every part of my journey. As an autistic person, this holiday can feel big and overwhelming, so I honor myself by setting boundaries that let me show up with love and stay regulated. This looks like taking sensory breaks when I need them, it doesnt matter who understands or ‘doesnt get it’  stepping outside for fresh air, keeping conversations gentle, and giving myself permission to leave early if my energy runs low. I navigate the social side of Thanksgiving by preparing ahead, choosing the quieter spaces, and reminding myself that it’s okay to take things at my own pace. Feeling thankful for the people who understand, support, and celebrate me exactly as I am. And thankful for the strength and self-knowledge that help me move through days like today with grace.

Wishing everyone a warm, safe, and heart-full Thanksgiving. 🤍🤍🤍🦋🌻

2,"Not all support is safe 👌🏽 White-led organizations, even with good intentions, can unintentionally control, police, or silence Black autistic voices. Racial bias, cultural misunderstanding, AND ableism can lead to misdiagnosis, restrictive interventions, and trauma 😟 Black autistic people face compounded discrimination racism & ableism which makes autonomy, trust, and community-led support more important than ever. Real change comes from listening, collaborating, and amplifying voices, not imposing solutions, & White-led orgs only supporting Black advocates they can ‘control’ is also a problem 👍🏽

3,"Racism doesn’t disappear inside autistic spaces and Black autistic people have been saying this for a long time. Autism doesn’t cancel out the biases we absorb from the world, and it doesn’t excuse harm, many autistic spaces aren’t safe spaces for Black #autistic people 👌🏽
Not all white autistic people are racist toward Black autistic people. But some are and that “some” is enough to cause real damage 🗣️
Talking about it isn’t division 👍🏽
Ignoring it is 👌🏽
If we want autistic spaces to be truly inclusive, we have to listen, unlearn, and make room for the experiences of Black autistic people loudly and unapologetically, because I’m going to keep sharing my experiences loudly & unapologetically 🫶🏽✨🦋

4,"Talking about race and autism isn’t dividing the autistic community  it’s strengthening it 🦋
When we name the racial disparities Black autistic people face, we’re not “pitting” anyone against anyone else, okay? because someone said thats what i was doing🙄, just because a conversation isnt always the most comfortable to have or its something you may not want to hear, or accept, doesnt mean its purpose is division, I’m acknowledging that not all autistic experiences are treated equally, and that’s something we have to face to make things better for everyone, again we dont grow in comfort and the uncomfortable conversations need to be had

🖤 Inclusion means listening to every story, especially the ones that have been ignored for too long🖤

5,"Happy Friday 🫶🏽just here to say this with love and clarity you don’t have to agree with everything I post. What I share comes from my lived experience as a Black autistic woman and from the things I’ve witnessed firsthand. Im not here to debate or argue. The energy you put into “correcting” or “challenging” me could be used to share your own perspective on YOUR page. We can absolutely agree to disagree but it’s no secret how Black autistic women are often treated, and that’s the truth I’m speaking from. If my posts make you uncomfortable or you feel the need to be passive-aggressive or tell me you don’t agree, that’s your right. But maybe, just maybe, this page isn’t the space for you and that’s okay too ☺️

6,"Society treats autistic women differently based on race! Not here to argue it’s a fact! 👌🏽 
White autistic women often get support and understanding, while Black autistic women are told to “be strong” and cope alone 🥴
This isn’t about toughness it’s about bias. From stereotypes to late diagnoses to invisibility in media, Black autistic women face barriers that white women often don’t.

It’s time we listen, validate, and support all autistic women equally 🫶🏽✨

9,"Autistic solidarity should be rooted in justice, not sameness 🌺We don’t all experience the world the same  especially across racial lines. When whiteness is centered in the convo, Black autistic voices get erased. If autism makes the world feel unsafe, now imagine that plus racial profiling, systemic bias, and medical neglect 👌🏽
Stop saying “we all struggle the same.” 😒 We don’t.
Solidarity isn’t about comparison  it’s about listening. It’s about knowing that race shapes how autism is seen, treated, and punished. White autistic people: your struggles are real  and they’re not the same as Black autistic struggles.
Hold space for that difference. Don’t flatten it. Be mindful. Be humble.

11,"Stereotypes can create blind spots 🫶🏽 When people think of autism meltdowns, they often imagine yelling, crying, or visible distress a picture shaped by white, male presentations of autism ♾️
But Black women don’t always fit that mold. Our meltdowns might look like shutdowns. Silence. Irritability. Masking. Disassociation. And too often, we’re misjudged seen as angry, cold, or aggressive.
This misunderstanding isn’t harmless. It leads to misdiagnosis, lack of support, and serious consequences for our mental health.

I stim all the time.
Most folks just don’t clock it.
👀👀👀
That’s the thing about being a high-masking autistic black woman… people see “calm” ..“chill” …“put together” and don’t realize I’m running a whole backstage operation just to hold it down. (Beyoncé on tour with Janet Jackson production)
🤣🤣🤣
So let me educate ya for Autism Awareness Month and for my own damn peace:
I pace.
I rock like an old record player on loop.
I repeat lil sounds under my breath and sometimes it’s a word, sometimes it’s a hum, but it keeps me from spiraling.
I fidget with whatever’s in reach like rings, pens, hoodie strings.
I stare at light patterns like it’s art. (And it is!!)
I rub my tongue across my teeth even when I don’t want to. (That one bugs me, but yeah doing it now. 🤦🏾‍♀️ it’s real.)
I scratch at fabric or my arm when I’m overstimulated, or when the vibes are just… too loud. ( my skin no but fabric yes. 
💕💕💕
It’s not always cute and It’s not for show.
It’s regulation. It’s release. It’s what helps me stay here.

I’m not hiding it this month.

24,"Loving a Black Autistic Woman: Action Over Words

Loving a Black autistic woman—whether as a friend, acquaintance, lover, or collaborator, family or follower—is not just words; it’s action.

It’s understanding her need for quiet when the world is too loud and holding space for her thoughts when they flow like a river. It’s learning the language of her boundaries, respecting her independence, and cherishing her authenticity without trying to change her.

It’s recognizing the layers she carries—the intersection of her Blackness, her neurodivergence, and her brilliance—and meeting her with care, not assumptions.

It’s showing up consistently, proving through your actions that she is valued, heard, and safe. Loving her is a verb, a daily practice of seeing her fully and honoring the beautiful complexity of who she is. Ask yourself what you bring to her life and how you contribute before you take from her light and energy.

Not everyone knows how to do this. Many covet her light and her empathy, seeking to take without giving, but they cannot hold her truth because they were never ready to honor it.

When she finds those who respect her boundaries and celebrate her fullness, she finds her home. Loving her means standing in her light—not dimming it.

🖤 To love her in any capacity is to rise to the occasion, meet her with care, and reflect her brilliance. #BlackAutisticWoman #Neurodiversity #BlackExcellence #Intersectionality",2024-12-08 10:36:14,177957956,lovettejallow,https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/469619080_18471186667037957_4931395043809148777_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080_sh0.08_tt6&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QFyztTXNOe2RF_hSkaIjpPi0dHncnMwwg7bnQSEL3XdYmJOApxB7cLTIeBbxDlT_FM_bAjHtuC9g6r1DZWdL6gd&_nc_ohc=5ieKguBMG1oQ7kNvwEgTk1V&_nc_gid=ZeoMkWimCHdmy4IEhXXMnw&edm=AA0rjkIBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfjNu7xg4Lk3fFzO9kzMQHAn3Kxvd9U43q77gTh_acwB3w&oe=6933B06F&_nc_sid=49ed71
25,"CRM: Where do you see things going in the next 5-10 years?
🦋
Ayanna Sanaa : My hope is that it shifts to be even more inclusion of black autistic women and the stigma around autism is removed, people sometimes shy away from us when they learn your autistic before even getting to know you before even giving you a chance all because of their ignorance from what they have heard so my hopes are that society dissolves some of these and we are given a fair chance at life, I also hope to see the media handle autism with more care a lot of times there is a lot of misinformation being spread about autism or you are only hearing about the bad side but rarely the joys, there’s so much about autism that people need to see there are so many things this world can learn from our neurodivergent minds ♾️

28,"LFAP: Comment on society’s
understanding/acceptance of you as an Autistic Black person. In other words, in what ways are you embraced in your community or society at large and in what ways are you misunderstood or ignored?
I feel Black Autistic women are just now being embraced because more black women are starting be diagnosed. For so long, black women were being misdiagnosed, late diagnosed, or not diagnosed at all. So as diagnoses become more common, I feel society will become more accepting and the stigma can be removed about black women being just angry (in fact, we can be neurodivergent). I feel that’s where the misunderstanding comes-in the stereotype of the angry, black woman, when, in fact, we were neurodivergent. I have heard this about myself because I can come off as standoffish when I’m feeling overstimulated, which can translate into being unfriendly, which can translate into angry. But I was none of that the entire time, I was just autistic. - Phenomenally Autistic

Attending a Somali Community event where a doctor explained how a family did not understand the concept of autism because they did not have a word for it in their language made me think about how many more communities could be going through the same thing.

Here are the words I found that attempted to define autism and their approximate translation:

1. In Swahili: Ugonjwa wa akili ya kujirudia (repetitive mind disorder)
2. In Amharic: የሃይማኖት የመጥፋት ሥርዓት (behavioral development disorder)
3. In Yoruba: Ọ̀rọ̀ àìsàn ara (behavior disorder)
4. In Hausa: Muguɗi na ayyukan (mind disorder)
5. In Zulu: Ukwesaba ukugula (fear or strange illness)
6. In Swazi: Ligci elincane lokuhlupheka (small mind disorder)
7. In Igbo: Njụjụ ndị ọrụ ego (behavioral disorder)

From the translations, it can be perceived that the medical model is currently the reference point when talking about autism in Africa. Do you know any other word to define autism? Let me know in the comments 😉

31,"CRM? We often hear about learning lessons – but just as important is unlearning lessons. Have you ever had to unlearn a lesson?
Ayanna- A lesson I had to unlearn was that I was unworthy and that my voice did not matter the backstory is really simple is very common for disabled people feel unseen and unheard and I was told by a professional authority figure when I was a teenager that I wouldn’t get very far or be much in life and I believed her and that stuck with me for a very long time it start to change until I received my autism diagnosis and my self love and worth journey began and I realized not only am I worthy I’m more than worthy 🦋♾️💜🫶🏽

32,"Happy #AutismAwareness and #AutsimAcceptanceMonth! I wanted to take the time to re-introduce myself and share my journey of getting a #diagnosis. This month I want to center the voices of #AutsticCreators across the #Spectrum while focusing on the impact #Autism has specifically on #BlackWomen and #BlackGirls. My hope is that this month everyone continues to educate themselves on Autism, and advocates for full inclusion and acceptance. My experience is just one of millions of diverse experiences across the spectrum, so be sure to check out other Autistic creators.

4. ""Finding ASD testing wasn't easy because of the long waitlist, lack of providers who accept insurance, and finding a provider who wouldn't dismiss me as a Black woman.""

5. ""It was important for me to get a clinical diagnosis because I wanted to understand who I was fully, and how I could better advocate and accommodate myself.""

6. ""Since receiving my diagnosis, I have been supported by my family and friends. I want to use my platform to advocate for Black Autistic Voices.""]

36,"When I finally found some friends in school I loved being around them. But felt like I was still hiding a part of me. It was hard floating between groups and not feeling like I truly belonged in either one of them. I still preferred to hang out with family at the weekends and spend time alone. I didn’t realise that I was meant to enjoy hanging around with people my age all the time! Friendships were confusing as an undiagnosed autistic teenager!

38,"Allowing myself to have meltdowns and shutdowns and giving myself grace afterwards. Knowing my struggles and experiences are valid. Being kinder to myself when I’m burnout. It means meeting my needs and self advocating for them. Having the right to express myself and be listened to. Revisiting childhood stims and interests. It means not putting pressure on myself to live up to neurotypical standards. 

Taking a break from masking and neurotypicals when it all becomes too much! To do things that I enjoy without fear or judgement. To feel autistic joy. To not be ashamed of being autistic or the way that my brain works. Unmasking when I feel safe enough to. Autism is a big part of me, it’s who I am! It affects everything that I do. I’m learning to be the person that younger me needed growing up!

39,"We might not have been put on medication for mental health conditions that we were constantly misdiagnosed with. Or put through therapy that is not made for our brains. It would have saved so many of us from only getting diagnosed after reaching crisis point. If only autism was considered as a possibility in the first place! Instead of being overlooked. Not being diagnosed until my mid 20’s definitely impacted my mental health. I look forward to the day where many of us are diagnosed earlier. If I didn’t delve into the possibility of being autistic I probably would’ve never received a diagnosis. I didn’t even consider it a possibility myself until I researched it in depth and had many  aha moments relating to personal experiences of other autistics! 

As someone who was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in my early 20’s. Before my autism diagnosis at 25, I went through many treatments and medications with no improvement. I told the doctor that the office at my job at the time, was too loud and bright and was diagnosed with anxiety. I was constantly signed off of work with anxiety and depression and struggled with my mental health. Still autism was not considered until years later. 

A few months after my autism diagnosis and researching about autistic burnout. I asked for autistic burnout to be put on a sick note. My sick note said depression and anxiety instead. I look forward to seeing autistic burnout on a sick note and it being understood by health professionals, employers, more of us auties and society. I also look forward to an autism diagnosis being considered earlier and not being an after thought! There is still a long way to go! 

Disclaimer: you can be autistic and be diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have other diagnoses. Autistic burnout can mimic the symptoms of depression but the two are different. Please seek help if you need it. I’m not a medical professional this is my personal experience and viewpoint. 

p.s-love this audio so used it twice in a row

40,"Like many autistics, growing up I was bullied and ostracised for my autistic traits. My classmates and some teachers just saw me as a child who was a quiet and sensitive soul. It was more than just being “sensitive” “over dramatic” or quiet and shy. My autistic traits were missed and overlooked especially being a girl. A young Black girl. No one would’ve thought that I was autistic. But it was autism all along.

45,"I wish that I knew this when I first discovered that I was autistic. At first, I compared my experiences to other autistic people all the time. As a result, I experienced imposter syndrome and often doubted whether I was actually autistic. Then when I got my autism diagnosis I realised as a Black autistic woman.  I am a minority within a minority. 

However, I’ve realised this year that my experiences may be similar to other people but not necessarily the same in a lot of ways and that’s okay. My experience as a Black autistic person is unique to me because I have different needs and my culture and race impacts my experience. 

When you’ve met one autistic person you’ve met one autistic person. Every autistic person is different! This is not me saying that we cannot relate to each other as autistics. But just a little reminder that our experiences are unique and similar too! The experience of being autistic is different for each of us as individuals. The autism spectrum is not linear it’s endless ♾️
