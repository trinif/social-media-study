Communication styles in Black autistic girls can be wonderfully diverse and unique. They may use mimicry of peers or more subtle forms of echolalia as part of their communication process, differing from more direct communication challenges observed in others. Recognizing and valuing these nuances can greatly enhance how we support effective communication. What strategies or supports have worked well for you or your community?
