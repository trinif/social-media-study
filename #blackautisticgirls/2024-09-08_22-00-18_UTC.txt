Black autistic girls may express themselves differently in social settings compared to their peers. Instead of visible withdrawal, we might 'mask' to navigate social expectations, which can sometimes delay recognition and support. Understanding these unique social coping strategies is vital. Have you observed these patterns in your community? Share your insights and how you support authentic connections in your experiences. Let’s celebrate and embrace the diverse ways Black autistic girls engage with the world! #BlackAutisticGirls #AuthenticConnections #NeurodiversityAwareness
