Whether you’re a Black autistic woman, a mother raising one, or a professional helping families navigate transitions, you know the power of representation.⁠
⁠
We’re calling on our community to help shape the 2025 Black Autistic Girls & Women’s Summit.⁠
⁠
✨ Create sessions that speak directly to puberty, mental health, self-advocacy, career prep, and relationships.⁠
✨ Lead a conversation that helps Black mothers and daughters bridge understanding.⁠
✨ Offer tools and hope to girls who are often unseen.⁠
⁠
Submissions due: September 6⁠
Event date: October 11⁠
