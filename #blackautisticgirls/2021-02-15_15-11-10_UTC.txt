Long Post for parents and caregivers of those with unique needs.

This is a pic of A younger Young Money & Rose on Valentine’s Day 2013

My heart overflows with love for these 2 beings.

When The Most High crowned me with motherhood I thought that it would be like I seen growing up. It has NOT been that. 

Our journey hasn’t been easy from the start but, I’m proud to declare that we’ve made it  through all the things that could’ve destroyed us. We made it through premature birth, diagnosis, misdiagnosis, miraculous healings, homelessness, aggressive &  combative behavior, being non verbal, divorce, remarriage, and now we’re at the dawning of the teen years.

The things that were set out to destroy us has only solidified the fact that we’re covered by The Most High and the blood of the Hamashiach. What was meant to destroy us has made us. 

To a mother or father that is in the thick of not understanding your child’s behaviors, be encouraged. 

Maybe your in the midst of the diagnostic process, be encouraged. 

Maybe you just got a diagnosis, and it’s hard for you to roll with it, be encouraged. 

Maybe your marriage is on the brink because the weight of having a special needs child, be encouraged.

You are alive for a purpose. You and your children will journey through these seasons in life and you’ll look back with tears of joy declaring with much pride that, We Made it! 

Be encouraged friends!
