I was super pleased to be able to attend this webinar at lunchtime today! Tiffany Nelson shared her crucial research so clearly and succinctly. There were (sadly) some shocking experiences that Black autistic girls shared through the research and, as I already knew, there’s so much change that’s needed to improve their experiences. This is unique research and there’s nothing else out there like this at the moment but I hope this is the start of much more to come. I believe that the session recording will be available online to watch on replay and I urge others in the education arena to go and do so. Let me know in the comments if you’d like the link and I’ll do my best you find it and share it with you! Thanks for sharing your work Tiffany.
