Patience Agbabi FRSL is a poet and middle-grade #novelist.  Her latest #poetry #book is Telling Tales (Canongate, 2014), a 21st century multicultural retelling of The Canterbury Tales. 

In 2020 she launched #TheLeapCycle, a time-travel #adventures series for 8—12 year olds with a neurodivergent cast of #characters.  The first book, The Infinite (Canongate 2020), was CBBC Book of the Month for July last year. The #sequel, The Time-Thief, came out in May 2021.

It’s midsummer’s day and thirteen-year-old Elle and her Leapling classmates are visiting the #Museum of the Past, the Present and the Future. But on the day of the school trip, disaster strikes, and the most unique and valuable piece in the museum, the Infinity-Glass, is stolen! And worse still, Elle’s friend and fellow Infinite, MC², is arrested for the crime!

To prove his innocence Elle must leap back centuries in time, to a London very different from today. Along the way she will meet new friends, face dangers unlike any she has ever known, and face an old enemy who is determined to destroy her. Can Elle find the missing Infinity-Glass and return it to its rightful home before it’s too late?

“In The Time-Thief, Agbabi has written a second instalment to the Leap Cycle series that even exceeds the first.  Elle is a delightful character to follow: not just a well-rounded heroine with a unique set of beautiful insights, but also an important example of meaningful representation in a literary arena where #Blackautisticgirls are rarely represented.  In reading The Time-Thief you also get a clear sense of how much Agbabi loves #creative wordplay, as she tells a gripping time-travel story that keeps you guessing, while clearly having fun with the English language along the way! A creative, imaginative novel with a fascinating lead character”
