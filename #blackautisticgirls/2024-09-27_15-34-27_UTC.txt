🎉 The Black Girls and Women's Autism Summit is happening on October 19th, and I’m honored to be a part of it! This virtual event is a must-attend for Black autistic girls, women, and their families. We'll explore key life transitions, mental health, communication, and my bag- sexuality! 

Let’s create a supportive community together! This is YOUR chance to learn, connect, and
grow with others who understand your journey.

🎟 Free tickets are available now, but for lifetime access to all recordings and exclusive workbooks, upgrade to VIP!
