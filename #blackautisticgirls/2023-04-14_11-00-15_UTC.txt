When you tell someone they don't look 'autistic', you're not only being dismissive, but also offensive and invalidating - and that's because autism is much more than what popular media often portrays it as. It's not all quirky, entertaining, and fun; it simply means that people on the spectrum process information and stimuli from the world around them in a unique way.

It's not a compliment to tell someone they don't look Autistic. In fact, it's an ablest micro-aggression. 

We can all make a difference and #bethechange when it comes to showing respect for the Autistic community. Let's not make assumptions about how someone should look - let's focus on understanding, inclusivity, acceptance, and end the #stereotypes. 

⭐️ Let's empower ourselves with knowledge and create a better future for all - starting now! Together, we can make a meaningful difference.
