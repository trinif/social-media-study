Research shows that girls are less likely than boys to receive a timely diagnosis of autism, and that Black children are more likely to experience misdiagnosis and extremely delayed autism diagnosis. Autistic Black girls, at the intersection of these disparities, experience the impact of both. This new grant award from @withfoundation will engage Black women self-advocates and family advocates to develop and disseminate educational materials about barriers to diagnostic supports for Black girls and women with autism, as well as recommendations to address the unique needs of this intersectional population across the lifespan. #HealthEquity #BlackAutisticGirls #HealthCareTransition www.familyvoices.org/healthcaretransition
