🗣️ Here’s another reason why parenting IN Christ is so important!

Just a month ago Kennedi was having a hard time getting acclimated to school with her High Functional Autism 🧠🌈 This week she’s prayed on her own on the way to school AND held every class leadership role they have!

She also sits near me when I write my prayers at night usually on her tablet or talking to me about random topics, but lately she’s started writing her prayers too! We lost our dog this week and she immediately asked for paper to “Write to GOD” (as she calls it). 
She wrote “GOD go find mommy’s dog please, lost dog” and said that she needed to write the “lyrics” to a song she was listening to! 

The next day… Guess who wagged his way back home! 😆 She was so excited to see that GOD really does answer her prayers! 

I thank GOD for ALL of who she is even at 5! 
Little does she know GOD checked off every prayer I had for her and her faith is only the foundation of how far He’s going to take her! 🫶🏾
