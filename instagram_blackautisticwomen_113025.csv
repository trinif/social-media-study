0,"🌱Five years in the vegan community.
🧩One year into understanding my autism.
🌍Already nomadic & abroad. 

And a lifetime of feeling unwelcome in spaces that preach compassion but can’t recognize to even begin to respect & regulate around difference when it’s in the room.

I’ve never fit the aesthetic of veganism.
Or monolithic cultural stereotypes. 
Not the polished wellness girl.
Not the mascot for purity or perfection.

And definitely not the version people imagine when they picture “community.”

I’m the antithesis of what people expect —
Black, autistic, queer, nomadic, self-taught, outspoken, spiritual but not church-bound,
a filmmaker documenting her life in real time
and a woman who built everything from scratch with NO blueprint.

I didn’t know I was the underdog until life made it impossible to deny.💯
Not in a sad way — in a clarifying way.

Because being the underdog didn’t break me.

It made my voice sharper.
My lens clearer.
My purpose as undeniable as my light. 

This is me — the human behind @vegansoultribe 
Natalee. Eason. 
🎬The director behind UNMASKED.
🌍The autistic & epileptic explorer & dog Trainer 🦮. 

The one creating from truth, not performance.

⛓️‍💥And I’m finally done shrinking to make people comfortable, even when that person is me. I’m expanding. 

Welcome to my world. 

 “The Place in which I’ll fit will not exist until I make it.” — James Baldwin

1,"Happy Thanksgiving 🫶🏽

Feeling so blessed today and everyday, for the people I love, the quiet moments that ground me, the routines that comfort me, and the little pieces of life that add up to something beautiful. Grateful for every part of my journey. As an autistic person, this holiday can feel big and overwhelming, so I honor myself by setting boundaries that let me show up with love and stay regulated. This looks like taking sensory breaks when I need them, it doesnt matter who understands or ‘doesnt get it’  stepping outside for fresh air, keeping conversations gentle, and giving myself permission to leave early if my energy runs low. I navigate the social side of Thanksgiving by preparing ahead, choosing the quieter spaces, and reminding myself that it’s okay to take things at my own pace. Feeling thankful for the people who understand, support, and celebrate me exactly as I am. And thankful for the strength and self-knowledge that help me move through days like today with grace.

Wishing everyone a warm, safe, and heart-full Thanksgiving. 🤍🤍🤍🦋🌻

2,"Not all support is safe 👌🏽 White-led organizations, even with good intentions, can unintentionally control, police, or silence Black autistic voices. Racial bias, cultural misunderstanding, AND ableism can lead to misdiagnosis, restrictive interventions, and trauma 😟 Black autistic people face compounded discrimination racism & ableism which makes autonomy, trust, and community-led support more important than ever. Real change comes from listening, collaborating, and amplifying voices, not imposing solutions, & White-led orgs only supporting Black advocates they can ‘control’ is also a problem 👍🏽

3,"Racism doesn’t disappear inside autistic spaces and Black autistic people have been saying this for a long time. Autism doesn’t cancel out the biases we absorb from the world, and it doesn’t excuse harm, many autistic spaces aren’t safe spaces for Black #autistic people 👌🏽
Not all white autistic people are racist toward Black autistic people. But some are and that “some” is enough to cause real damage 🗣️
Talking about it isn’t division 👍🏽
Ignoring it is 👌🏽
If we want autistic spaces to be truly inclusive, we have to listen, unlearn, and make room for the experiences of Black autistic people loudly and unapologetically, because I’m going to keep sharing my experiences loudly & unapologetically 🫶🏽✨🦋

4,"Autistic meltdowns aren’t “misbehavior” — especially for Black women.
Because of racism, sexism, and cultural pressure to stay composed, many Black autistic women learn to shut down, withdraw, mask, or cry in private instead of melting down visibly. And too often, our distress gets labeled as “attitude,” “anger,” or “being rude.”

The truth is:
🧠 Meltdowns are neurological overload
🧠 Masking is a survival skill — but it leads to burnout
🧠 Black autistic women are underdiagnosed, punished, or dismissed
🧠 Our pain is misunderstood because society only recognizes the white male presentation of autism

Black autistic women deserve understanding, safety, and real support — not judgment.

Meltdowns are communication, not defiance.

5,"Talking about race and autism isn’t dividing the autistic community  it’s strengthening it 🦋
When we name the racial disparities Black autistic people face, we’re not “pitting” anyone against anyone else, okay? because someone said thats what i was doing🙄, just because a conversation isnt always the most comfortable to have or its something you may not want to hear, or accept, doesnt mean its purpose is division, I’m acknowledging that not all autistic experiences are treated equally, and that’s something we have to face to make things better for everyone, again we dont grow in comfort and the uncomfortable conversations need to be had

🖤 Inclusion means listening to every story, especially the ones that have been ignored for too long🖤

6,"Happy Friday 🫶🏽just here to say this with love and clarity you don’t have to agree with everything I post. What I share comes from my lived experience as a Black autistic woman and from the things I’ve witnessed firsthand. Im not here to debate or argue. The energy you put into “correcting” or “challenging” me could be used to share your own perspective on YOUR page. We can absolutely agree to disagree but it’s no secret how Black autistic women are often treated, and that’s the truth I’m speaking from. If my posts make you uncomfortable or you feel the need to be passive-aggressive or tell me you don’t agree, that’s your right. But maybe, just maybe, this page isn’t the space for you and that’s okay too ☺️

8,"Society treats autistic women differently based on race! Not here to argue it’s a fact! 👌🏽 
White autistic women often get support and understanding, while Black autistic women are told to “be strong” and cope alone 🥴
This isn’t about toughness it’s about bias. From stereotypes to late diagnoses to invisibility in media, Black autistic women face barriers that white women often don’t.

It’s time we listen, validate, and support all autistic women equally 🫶🏽✨

13,"Autistic solidarity should be rooted in justice, not sameness 🌺We don’t all experience the world the same  especially across racial lines. When whiteness is centered in the convo, Black autistic voices get erased. If autism makes the world feel unsafe, now imagine that plus racial profiling, systemic bias, and medical neglect 👌🏽
Stop saying “we all struggle the same.” 😒 We don’t.
Solidarity isn’t about comparison  it’s about listening.It’s about knowing that race shapes how autism is seen, treated, and punished. White autistic people: your struggles are real  and they’re not the same as Black autistic struggles.

18,"Stereotypes can create blind spots 🫶🏽When people think of autism meltdowns, they often imagine yelling, crying, or visible distress a picture shaped by white, male presentations of autism ♾️
But Black women don’t always fit that mold.Our meltdowns might look like shutdowns. Silence. Irritability. Masking. Disassociation. And too often, we’re misjudged seen as angry, cold, or aggressive.
This misunderstanding isn’t harmless.It leads to misdiagnosis, lack of support, and serious consequences for our mental health.

19,"“It feels weird to be “seen” I have always kinda took the backseat and been very private but sharing my autism journey was a way for me to learn about being autistic and teach others about autism, teach others how to treat me, I never thought things would be the way they are now to be 😏 “celebrated” just for being myself is such a surreal feeling especially since most of my life it was the complete opposite I was not celebrated, I was belittled, bullied and made to feel like I was the weirdest person on earth, the fact that more and more Black autistic women are being seen, heard and celebrated is so crucial for our contribution to society, teaching others how autism manifest differently in black woman since culturally we have a different experience as Black autistics than white autistics, being able to use my platforms to amplify my voice and the voices of others is important being that Black women are often late diagnosed (like | was ) misdiagnosed (like I was) or never diagnosed, which I came close to, if we are better understood culturally than those on the outside looking in can learn what Autism looks like in Black women “🖤
.

I never set out to be “known” I just started sharing my journey to better understand myself and help others understand autism through a different lens. Being able to speak up, educate, and uplift the voices of Black autistic women is a responsibility I hold close.
We deserve to be seen. We deserve to be heard. And we deserve to be celebrated not in spite of who we are, but because of who we are. Thank you to everyone who listens, learns, and continues to amplify. 🦋♾️🫶🏽💜

25,"Using the word “rebranding” to describe someone’s autism diagnosis (even SD) is harmful because it implies deceit or trend-chasing, rather than recognizing a deeper truth about who they’ve always been 🦋A deeper truth about why life for so long was a mystery to us , ✨Diagnosis isn’t rebranding, for me it was relief ,it was clarity, healing, and finally having answers for a lifelong of confusion and pain ❤️‍🩹 Statements like this are harmful because they stigmatize Black autistic women,especially those newly diagnosed, by suggesting they’re faking or seeking attention. Many Black autistic women are misdiagnosed for years with Cluster B disorders due to gender bias. Reframing isn’t rebranding,it’s finally being seen 🌺🦋🫶🏽♾️💜✨

29,"✨ 10 Things NOT to Say to Someone Who Just Found Out They’re AuDHD ✨

When I first started sharing my self-discovery journey — that I’m autistic and have ADHD — I was met with a mix of support, confusion, and some truly unhelpful comments.

And I get it — most people don’t mean harm. But words matter. And when someone is already feeling raw, exposed, and unsure… the last thing they need is to be doubted or dismissed.

If someone trusts you enough to share something this personal, please pause before you respond. Curiosity goes further than correction. Compassion goes further than critique.

This post isn’t to shame — it’s to educate. To show just how easy it is to accidentally invalidate someone’s truth… and how much more powerful it is to just listen.

31,"💔 If you’ve ever wanted to run away from your life — read this.⁣

 You’re tired. But not the kind of tired a nap can fix.

You’re overwhelmed. But you keep pushing because you have no choice.⁣
 ⁣
The kids need you. The bills are due. Your job is draining you.

You feel like you’re drowning in chaos.⁣
 ⁣
You forget things. Snap at your family. Cry in the bathroom.⁣

You try to keep it together — but inside, you’re unraveling.⁣
 ⁣
You feel like a bad mom, a bad partner, a bad friend.

You feel like everyone else got the manual for life… except you.⁣
 ⁣
But what if there’s more to the story?⁣

What if you’re not lazy or broken or failing?⁣

What if your brain just works differently — and no one ever told you?⁣ (or knew to tell you)
 ⁣
For some, things like constant overwhelm, brain fog, emotional shutdowns, and chronic self-doubt aren’t just “bad habits.”

They can be signs of unrecognized patterns — especially in women, especially in Black women.⁣
 ⁣
You’re not alone. You’re not crazy.⁣

And you don’t have to keep carrying this in silence.⁣
 
Maybe it’s time to get curious.

To explore the why behind what you feel.

To finally give yourself the understanding you’ve always needed.⁣
 ⁣
You’re doing the absolute most with the absolute least.

And you deserve support. Space. Clarity. Relief.

You don’t have to do it alone anymore. 🖤💫
 ⁣
 With love,

 Global Kristen

32,"There wasn’t a single moment where everything clicked.
No dramatic unmasking, no perfect phrasing.
Just slow, quiet reclamation.

I found my voice in fragments —
in the words I whispered to myself first.
In the late-night journaling, the quiet truths I thought were too small to matter.
But they did.

Voice isn’t always volume.
Sometimes it’s knowing what you no longer have to explain.
What you no longer owe to anyone but yourself.

This reflection is for the soft-spoken, the slowly blooming, the ones still rewriting what it means to be heard. 💬

34,"MEET NICOLE GARLIC ♾️ Creator, executive producer, and director of “Show Me What It Feels Like.” 

As a communication scholar with a legal background, her research centers on communication and self-advocacy. She investigates self-advocacy in spaces of justice, including the transmission and reception of justice-related information online. As an instructor and documentary filmmaker, she highlights the experiences of autistic people, working to increase understanding and pursue a more inclusive society.

Nicole states, “As an autistic woman of color, I am excited to make a film where our experiences are centered. For many of us, autism is experienced internally, and the visual medium of documentary can bring these experiences to light.”

35,"Autism in Black women is misdiagnosed, dismissed, or completely overlooked.

❌ Why? Medical bias, outdated diagnostic tools, and societal expectations erase our experiences.
⚠️ Our traits? Labeled as “difficult.”
💭 Our struggles? Brushed off as “just anxiety.”
🛑 Our survival? Masking 24/7—because being different comes with consequences.

And when we finally figure it out?
“You don’t look autistic.”

But here’s the truth: Black autistic women exist. We exist.
And we’re done being erased.

38,"It wouldn't be my birth month if I didn't make some long winded thought dump about the existential dread of completing another revolution on this rock.
I remember last year. Didn't know if I'd make it to 28 but it was a big deal for me not being a part of the ""27 Club"". Here I am almost did not make it to 29 and... taking life one moment at a time with a very different perspective on life and what's most important to me.
Well, it's always been important to me... but something about laying in a hospital bed for 12 days listening to the agonized pleas of your ward mates really acts as a catalyst for growth and understanding what it means to exist.
Life is still A LOT because governments, society, and capitalism but I'm in a way better environment than I had for the last 2 decades, and with people who choose to be my family and support.
I don't exactly feel sad right now... maybe a little somber... but absolutely grateful. Healing is a... minivan on life's roadways. Went through my share of hills and valleys, roadblocks, flats, cut brakes, vandals, shot suspensions, bad fuel, no gas and radiator leaks... I'm okay for now. I'm still going. A whole lot slower but I'm going.

41,"“It’s exhausting to be someone else, be your full self” -Issa Rae ✨
 As an #autisticadult sometimes not masking can be a challenge especially when you’ve done it for so long, especially when for most of my life ( late diagnosed) I didn’t know who I was so I hid  who I thought I truly was because I felt my true self was ‘wrong’ turns out I was just autistic 🥰♾️ masking WAS so exhausting I don’t mask anymore if I do it’s out of habit but I’ve made an intentional effort to be my true self with no apologies to anyone, is it completely safe to unmask an a black autistic woman? Absolutely not because I can come off at different times as so many different things and in certain situations it may seem inappropriate, aggressive rude etc when in reality it’s only those things because people are uneducated about autism & unmasking but it’s unfair for autistic people to make ourselves uncomfortable for the comfort of others we have done that long enough 🙏🏽🌻🌸 #actuallyautistic #autismacceptance #blackandautistic #autisticandblack #blackautisticwomen #autisticmasking #autisticmaskingishardwork #autisticmaskingisharmful #autismadvocate #autismadvocacy #autismadvocates #blackautismadvocate #blackautismadvocacy #autizzy #neurodivergent #neurodiversity #autisticwomen #autisminwomen #autisminclusion #autisminwomenandgirls #representationmatters #inclusionmatters #diversity #inclusion #autisticcreator",2024-06-05 16:26:32,24175768395,phenomenallyautistic,https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/447775101_335534182901351_1844992063973359525_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_tt6&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6IkZFRUQuaW1hZ2VfdXJsZ2VuLjE0NDB4MTc5Ni5zZHIuZjI5MzUwLmRlZmF1bHRfaW1hZ2UuYzIifQ&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QHhJzsbJhSImkPc6-XjzIzYJ4R9h1LnH3vmtZqzUJBaMoetOGSeBGq6fZaUf39qGXc0KfmNMIsahfaxeaBDKzrn&_nc_ohc=Pm0zmrQLMkkQ7kNvwFcq58T&_nc_gid=qcbLAqutzRZcRA0gSNwiNw&edm=ALQROFkBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MzM4MzgzNjcxNjgyNDgwMzQ1OA%3D%3D.3-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfheLayB1zGzOTf2dypbWA7cJFyAlda7MDolmzsanfMoYA&oe=6933D338&_nc_sid=fc8dfb
42,"LFAP: Comment on society’s
understanding/acceptance of you as an Autistic Black person. In other words, in what ways are you embraced in your community or society at large and in what ways are you misunderstood or ignored?
I feel Black Autistic women are just now being embraced because more black women are starting be diagnosed. For so long, black women were being misdiagnosed, late diagnosed, or not diagnosed at all. So as diagnoses become more common, I feel society will become more accepting and the stigma can be removed about black women being just angry (in fact, we can be neurodivergent). I feel that’s where the misunderstanding comes-in the stereotype of the angry, black woman, when, in fact, we were neurodivergent. I have heard this about myself because I can come off as standoffish when I’m feeling overstimulated, which can translate into being unfriendly, which can translate into angry. But I was none of that the entire time, I was just autistic. - Phenomenally Autistic

43,"Before I was diagnosed as #autistic I was on an extremely high amount of psych meds,because they didn’t know what was ‘wrong’ with me , I was already on a lot of meds because I have 5 autoimmune immune diseases & have to take those no getting around that 🤷🏽‍♀️ HOWEVER once I was diagnosed & knew I was autistic they kept me on a bipolar med 😒 for a long time I just went with the flow because I didn’t know it was for bipolar but then other doctors would ask me why are you on this it’s for bipolar I would bring it up to my psychiatrist & he would basically wave his hand and at me & talk over me 🥴 I feel like he was trying to ‘suppress’ my #autism traits since I wasn’t taking the med they gave me specifically for autism anymore, I started to really have a problem with this especially because one it made me sick , two here we go with the misdiagnosis of black woman, black woman can be & are #neurodivergent we are not all just angry some of us are bipolar we are#autistic some of us both, me I’m not both it’s hard to get doctors to listen to you when you have a disability when sometimes they treat you as if you don’t know your body, will always be unaware of what’s going on & wont stand up for yourself which for a long time I did not that was then this is now 😊

I’m working with autistic women from minority groups, who are very often not considered as part of the conversation. Here is Savannah, an undergraduate at Oxford University.

“I had a lot of grief, when I found out I was autistic, realising that I’d lost lots of possible friendships because people thought I was rude. I didn’t know what they meant when they said I was being rude, that I didn’t care. I was just not understanding social niceties, but it feels, as a black woman, that I’m not afforded the assumption, the benefit of the doubt, that just maybe I’m not intending to be horrible or insulting. I’m automatically perceived as angry and aggressive. I get that a lot. Or intimidating. I get called intimidating all the time. I’m a 5’3” woman with a walking stick. Why is a 6’2” white man calling me intimidating?”.

I’m still looking for a few more collaborators, so do get in touch (email rosie@rosiebarnes.com) if you’re interested, based in the UK, an autistic woman and from a minority group, I’d love to include you in the project. It will be published in the springtime by the Wellcome Collection online.

Its rare that we hear from Black autistic women, mature women, who have been THROUGH it.Dr. Pahla is a translator (4 languages), medical doctor, computer programmer, and so much more!
Her passions are connecting people, machine translation, and knowledge translation. Dr. Pahla has a unique way of digesting lots of complicated information and making sense of it. Dr. Pahla got her autism diagnosis as an adult.

We're grateful to learn from other autistic Black women like @blackautistickayla, @autisminblack,  and the women of @blackinneuro who share their important perspectives on everything from love, family life, and motherhood, to white supremacy and anti-Black racism.

54,"‘Reflecting on her formative years, Ayanna shared, ""I always sensed my differences but lacked
understanding. I was often perceived as the weird, awkward, black girl,' when in reality, my
struggles stemmed from anxiety and overstimulation. It was only seven years ago that I
received my autism diagnosis, and it was a complete revelation. The lack of representation for
black autistics, particularly black autistic women, inspired me to advocate for greater visibility.""

56,"""I want any girl who sees my portrait to be able to relate and to know that she is not alone. You can be Black and autistic. You can stay true to yourself and take strength and power from that.
I basically raised myself. Masking was a coping mechanism but also a survival technique, because I was the outcast everywhere. I was highly intelligent, on the Gifted and Talented register. I went to a mostly white school where I was never going to fit in. I was bullied and excluded, because I’m Black, because of my socio-economic situation, because I’m a woman.
I am very easily triggered and get very defensive of my safety because I’ve had an autistic meltdown misconstrued as a mental health crisis. I’ve been sectioned because of it. They see a Black woman who they’ve been told is angry, aggressive and all these other racial stereotypes. So you’re even more invisible as a Black autistic woman, invisible to the people who hold the keys to help, because they’re busy taking notes on your background and not actually listening to you. It’s something that really just needs to stop, it really does"".

“I want any girl who sees my portrait to be able to relate and to know that she is not alone. You can be Black and autistic. You can stay true to yourself and take strength and power from that” – Lauren.

When an autistic woman shares her diagnosis, people's responses can be very upsetting, from “You don’t look autistic,” to a straight up denial, “No you’re not.”

Today on #AutisticPrideDay, we’re sharing some of Rosie Barnes’s powerful portraits of autistic women and – in an article linked in our bio – their experiences of passing as ‘normal’ in a neurotypical society.

Images in order of appearance: Lauren, Alison, Louise, Belinda and Heidi, Sumita and Jayne.

65,"Anyone need a #dissertation idea? An exploratory study, case study, or qualitative study would make a great dissertation and would not require the difficult task of recruiting a large number of subjects. #universityresearchers have a real opportunity to gather and analyze large amounts of data on this topic. If you are a #blackautistic woman and want to share your experiences, send me a DM and I can share them anonymously.

“No you’re not” – a portrait of autistic women. 
 
In this sensitive series of portraits and interviews, photographer @rosiebarnesphoto acknowledges the voices and experiences of autistic women.
 
Lauren, 29. Event operations/project management, autism advocate, founder of Mask Off.
 
“I want any girl who sees my portrait to be able to relate and to know that she is not alone. You can be Black and autistic. You can stay true to yourself and take strength and power from that.
 
People see what’s on the surface and think that I’m outgoing, confident, eloquent, outspoken. It makes me feel trapped. I’ve had a lifetime of misdiagnosis, knowing I needed help, but not knowing what help to ask for, so never receiving any – something that’s not changed, even with a diagnosis.”

67,"(2 of 6) Linda, actor. (>> for Linda’s words). Another from the original collaborations from the last 4 years of ‘No You’re Not - A Portrait of Autistic Women’. 
.
Despite recent media coverage, there lingers a misconception that autism is rare in girls/women. The irony is that their struggles are often greater because of their successes, particularly in education and work, meaning they are even less likely to be believed and more likely to be misunderstood.

As we come to the close of Autism Awareness/Acceptance month,  we wanted to feature someone who exudes confidence, grace and is unapologetically herself. 

We had the pleasure of meeting with @phenomenallyautistic earlier this month. Ayanna shared a variety of her lived experiences with us from having a late diagnosis and the difference that made with how she was treated by doctors all the way to the challenges of dating. She also shed light on barriers that black autistic women face prior to receiving a diagnosis. Ayanna shared that after her diagnosis she was able to understand herself better, and teach other’s around her how to do the same!  

At Stand Social, we’re on a mission to become better allies which is why we appreciate meeting and getting to know individuals with lived experiences. We always want to ensure that we continue to learn, listen, and encourage others to do the same!💗
