3,"I was super pleased to be able to attend this webinar at lunchtime today! Tiffany Nelson shared her crucial research so clearly and succinctly. There were (sadly) some shocking experiences that Black autistic girls shared through the research and, as I already knew, there’s so much change that’s needed to improve their experiences. This is unique research and there’s nothing else out there like this at the moment but I hope this is the start of much more to come. I believe that the session recording will be available online to watch on replay and I urge others in the education arena to go and do so. Let me know in the comments if you’d like the link and I’ll do my best you find it and share it with you! Thanks for sharing your work Tiffany.

27,"🗣️ Here’s another reason why parenting IN Christ is so important!

Just a month ago Kennedi was having a hard time getting acclimated to school with her High Functional Autism 🧠🌈 This week she’s prayed on her own on the way to school AND held every class leadership role they have!

She also sits near me when I write my prayers at night usually on her tablet or talking to me about random topics, but lately she’s started writing her prayers too! We lost our dog this week and she immediately asked for paper to “Write to GOD” (as she calls it). 
She wrote “GOD go find mommy’s dog please, lost dog” and said that she needed to write the “lyrics” to a song she was listening to! 

The next day… Guess who wagged his way back home! 😆 She was so excited to see that GOD really does answer her prayers! 

I thank GOD for ALL of who she is even at 5! 
Little does she know GOD checked off every prayer I had for her and her faith is only the foundation of how far He’s going to take her! 🫶🏾

33,"When you tell someone they don't look 'autistic', you're not only being dismissive, but also offensive and invalidating - and that's because autism is much more than what popular media often portrays it as. It's not all quirky, entertaining, and fun; it simply means that people on the spectrum process information and stimuli from the world around them in a unique way.

It's not a compliment to tell someone they don't look Autistic. In fact, it's an ablest micro-aggression. 

We can all make a difference and #bethechange when it comes to showing respect for the Autistic community. Let's not make assumptions about how someone should look - let's focus on understanding, inclusivity, acceptance, and end the #stereotypes.

155,"Patience Agbabi FRSL is a poet and middle-grade #novelist.  Her latest #poetry #book is Telling Tales (Canongate, 2014), a 21st century multicultural retelling of The Canterbury Tales. 

In 2020 she launched #TheLeapCycle, a time-travel #adventures series for 8—12 year olds with a neurodivergent cast of #characters.  The first book, The Infinite (Canongate 2020), was CBBC Book of the Month for July last year. The #sequel, The Time-Thief, came out in May 2021.

It’s midsummer’s day and thirteen-year-old Elle and her Leapling classmates are visiting the #Museum of the Past, the Present and the Future. But on the day of the school trip, disaster strikes, and the most unique and valuable piece in the museum, the Infinity-Glass, is stolen! And worse still, Elle’s friend and fellow Infinite, MC², is arrested for the crime!

To prove his innocence Elle must leap back centuries in time, to a London very different from today. Along the way she will meet new friends, face dangers unlike any she has ever known, and face an old enemy who is determined to destroy her. Can Elle find the missing Infinity-Glass and return it to its rightful home before it’s too late?

“In The Time-Thief, Agbabi has written a second instalment to the Leap Cycle series that even exceeds the first.  Elle is a delightful character to follow: not just a well-rounded heroine with a unique set of beautiful insights, but also an important example of meaningful representation in a literary arena where #Blackautisticgirls are rarely represented.  In reading The Time-Thief you also get a clear sense of how much Agbabi loves #creative wordplay, as she tells a gripping time-travel story that keeps you guessing, while clearly having fun with the English language along the way! A creative, imaginative novel with a fascinating lead character”

This is a pic of A younger Young Money & Rose on Valentine’s Day 2013

My heart overflows with love for these 2 beings.

When The Most High crowned me with motherhood I thought that it would be like I seen growing up. It has NOT been that. 

Our journey hasn’t been easy from the start but, I’m proud to declare that we’ve made it  through all the things that could’ve destroyed us. We made it through premature birth, diagnosis, misdiagnosis, miraculous healings, homelessness, aggressive &  combative behavior, being non verbal, divorce, remarriage, and now we’re at the dawning of the teen years. APBTTMHG 

The things that were set out to destroy us has only solidified the fact that we’re covered by The Most High and the blood of the Hamashiach. What was meant to destroy us has made us. 

To a mother or father that is in the thick of not understanding your child’s behaviors, be encouraged. 

Maybe your in the midst of the diagnostic process, be encouraged. 

Maybe you just got a diagnosis, and it’s hard for you to roll with it, be encouraged. 

Maybe your marriage is on the brink because the weight of having a special needs child, be encouraged.

You are alive for a purpose. You and your children will journey through these seasons in life and you’ll look back with tears of joy declaring with much pride that, We Made it! 

Be encouraged friends!",2021-02-15 15:11:10,270529619,unapologeticallyebonie,https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/150902706_425292841884943_7501516173807737548_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_tt6&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6IkZFRUQuaW1hZ2VfdXJsZ2VuLjk1OXg5NTkuc2RyLmYyOTM1MC5kZWZhdWx0X2ltYWdlLmMyIn0&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QEFvahqXwb7ks3uIM7fef47R_nEQR9mmv8t4xNX_enpBlm41sgWluqQ-aqlg9ixCW-qDMf738g0gM3XZRsJvu1y&_nc_ohc=JUUB-YHohNIQ7kNvwHWkhP9&_nc_gid=_tXjE4tTf8k3AUWgkXpO8g&edm=ALQROFkBAAAA&ccb=7-5&ig_cache_key=MjUwOTcxOTI1MDgxMDYyNTY2Ng%3D%3D.3-ccb7-5&oh=00_AfjtpHA52J5ObdePMsDRrkks_Jb_wPSoLTGU3LIGa8taXQ&oe=6933C708&_nc_sid=fc8dfb
